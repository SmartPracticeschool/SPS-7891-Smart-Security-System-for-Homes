**Abstract:** Everything  is getting automatic  and smarter  with the passing of  days. It is  time to  make our  homes smarter and automated. Our resource of pure water and  power are limited and most of the time we use
these resources unconsciously in our household chores which leads us to a crucial future. So this is the time to utilize our resources thriftily. This system includes doors automation  with  password  protected  lock,  temperature fan - controlled ,  automated water pump,  water tap  and shower, light,  anti-theft  security  and  primary  fire  protection  using various  sensors like  LDR, IR,  pressure, smoke,  heat  & object sensors controlled by mainly microcontroller. Some features can be controlled by remote control system for more flexibility with the help of IBM Cloud Service. The goal of this system is to make our life more easy and safe as well as to save our resource and power.

## I. INTRODUCTION

Wireless Home security and Home automation are the dualaspects of this project. The currently built prototype of the system sends alerts to the owner over voice calls using the Internet if any sort of human movement is sensed near the entrance of his house and raises an alarm optionally upon the user‚Äôs discretion. The provision for sending alert messages to concerned security personnel in case of critical situation is also built into the system. On the other hand if the owner identiÔ¨Åes that the person may entering his house is not an intruder but an unexpected guest of his then instead of triggering the security alarm, the user/owner can make arrangements such as opening the door, switching on various appliances inside the house, which are also connected and controlled by the IBM Cloud/IBM IOT Platform in the system to welcome his guest. The same can be done when the user himself enters the room and by virtue of the system he can make arrangements from his doorstep such that as soon as he enters his house he can make himself at full comfort without manually having to switch on the electrical appliances or his favourite T.V. channel for anexample. Thus using the same set of sensors the dual problems of home security and home automation can be solved on a complementary basis.

The alerts and the status of the IoT system can be accessed by the user from anywhere using Internet Connection connected with IBM Cloud, MIT App with user's smart mobile phones.

## II. ADVANTAGES

This low cost system with minimum requirements takes care of both home security as well as home automation.
This home security uses MIP App,  so, providing better AI companionship features as private security.
IBM Cloud/ IOT Platform cares different services wthout any sensors/devices being triggered.
Since MIT App Inventor Account provides designing as well as companion with QR code/ 6 digit code, it can be accessible to admin.
Since it analyze with admin, there's no chance to get faulty with alarm service.

</p>

#### ‚≠ê What is IBM COS?
IBM Cloud Object Storage is integrated with IBM Watson Studio on IBM Cloud. When a machine learning project is created in IBM Watson Studio, an instance of IBM Cloud Object Storage is created automatically to accelerate the handling of the data required to train and deploy machine and deep learning models.
<br />

### ‚û§ Node Red App/Services

### RUNNING WORKFLOWS
Flexing humidity, temperature, & the number of people standing in front of the door (safety), & options to whether the user should open the door or not? üßê
Also, OpenCV will let us know about the person standing in front of the webcam, & so it'll count by using cascading of the frontal face.

</p>

#### ‚≠ê What is MIT App Inventor?
MIT App Inventor is a web application integrated development environment originally provided by Google, and now maintained by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. It allows newcomers to computer programming to create application software(apps) for two operating systems: Android, and iOS, which, as of 8 July 2019, is in final beta testing. It is free and open-source software released under dual licensing: a Creative Commons Attribution ShareAlike 3.0 Unported license, and an Apache License 2.0 for the source code.
